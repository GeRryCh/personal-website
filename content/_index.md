**I build AI automation pipelines to make your business more productive and save you money.👷‍♂️🤖💰**

As an AI Automation Engineer with a 10+ year background in software development, I specialize in one thing: creating powerful operational efficiencies. I design and implement custom AI-integrated pipelines that absorb manual work, optimize your processes, and free up your team to focus on what truly matters.

When I'm not architecting automation, I'm usually singing with my guitar or exploring the creative limits of artificial intelligence. 🎸🤖
