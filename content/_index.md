**Hi, I'm German. I use AI to make your business more productive and save you money.**

As an AI Automation Engineer with a 10+ year background in software development, I specialize in one thing: creating powerful operational efficiencies. I design and implement custom AI-integrated pipelines that absorb manual work, optimize your processes, and free up your team to focus on what truly matters.
The result is a more efficient workflow and a healthier bottom line.

When I'm not architecting automation, I'm usually singing with my guitar or exploring the creative limits of artificial intelligence. ðŸŽ¸ðŸ¤–
