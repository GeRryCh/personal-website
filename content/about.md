With over a decade of hands-on software engineering experience, I bridge the gap between business strategy and AI-driven execution. My career is distinguished by a unique blend of deep technical skills, demonstrated by mastering the full development lifecycle, and the strategic insights gained from an MBA. This allows me to not only identify business bottlenecks but also to personally architect and build the AI-powered solutions that resolve them.

Currently, I am working as a self-employed AI Automation Engineer, where I help businesses become more efficient by replacing manual work with intelligent automation systems. I specialize in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and powerful low-code platforms to create custom workflows that streamline processes and deliver significant cost savings.

Previously, as an AI Advocate at Lightricks, a position established by the CTO, I led the innovation of AI-powered tools to enhance the development process. I have a passion for building robust solutions and have developed several products that directly impact business productivity and the bottom line. I enjoy tackling complex challenges and am always eager to connect with others who are passionate about technology and innovation.
